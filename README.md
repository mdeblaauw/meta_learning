# meta_learning
Meta learning repo that has a reproducible experimental environment implemented with Pytorch. The main focus is to run this package on Sagemaker, such that experiments can be easily executed. 

## Implemented meta-learning algorithms

- [Prototypical networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05175)

## Available data sources

- [Omniglot](https://web.mit.edu/cocosci/Papers/Science-2015-Lake-1332-8.pdf)
    - Follow the `sagemaker_initiators/prepare_omniglot/preprocess_omniglot.ipynb` notebook to create the preprocessed omniglot data.
